# Next.js 15 - Unexpected Error with next/link and Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15 when using the `next/link` component in conjunction with dynamic routes.  The error is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.  It appears to be linked to client-side routing and the hydration process.

## Bug Description

The issue manifests as an unexpected error during client-side navigation, specifically when using `next/link` to navigate to a dynamically generated route.  The error message is often vague and unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the about page using the link.
5. Observe the intermittent error in the console (may require multiple attempts).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper route handling within the dynamic routing mechanism.  Please refer to `bugSolution.js` for a possible fix that involves using a more robust method for route construction.
